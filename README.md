GA5 README template.
- Add your answers to each question's section below.
- For each question where we want you to add your commands,
  put the command(s) you ran in the terminal in the corresponding ```bash code block.
- Where we want to see a command's output, there is a plain ``` code block
  right below the command block: paste the output there.
- The code to run each step of the workflow goes in `protocol.md`, not here:
  you don't need to repeat it in this file.
- You don't need to paste the contents of your scripts into this file:
  we will look at the scripts in your `scripts` dir directly
  (so make sure you commit them!).

# GA5 answers - <your-name>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part A: Your project dir, Git repo, and protocol

### 1: Fill in the top of the protocol

### 2: Markdown formatting

### 3: Create subdirs, and copy the scripts

```bash
# Your mkdir command:
mkdir -p data/ref scripts results
```

### 4: Initialize a Git repository, and commit your first files

### 5: Download the reference transcriptome

Code to count the number of transcripts:

```bash
# Your command:
zcat data/ref/GCF_016801865.2_TS_CPP_V2_rna.fna.gz | grep -c ">"
```

The output of the command was:

```
28624
```

*Answer*: The number of transcripts in the file: 28,624 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part B: Read trimming

### 6: Run TrimGalore

*Answer*: Whether all batch jobs succeeded, and how you checked that
(and any problems you encountered, and how you solved them):

All batch jobs did succeed. I first used to grep to determine if any jobs did not successfully finish and then I checked the number of HTML files to make sure it was 44. 

```bash
# My commands
grep -c "Successfully finished" slurm-trimgalore*.out
ls results/trim_galore/*html | wc -l
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part C: Transcript quantification with Salmon

### 7: Create the Salmon index

Code to check the size of the index dir:

```bash
# Your command:
du -sh results/salmon_index
```

The output of the command was:

```
1.1G    results/salmon_index
```

*Answer*: How long it took to create the index, and how you found out: 

It took about a minute to create the index. I looked at the output to see what time it started (8:15:28 PM) and what time it finished (08:16:30 PM). 

*Answer*: The size of the index dir: 1.1 G

### 8: Run Salmon for all samples

### 9: The transcripts with the most reads

*Answer*: What the `NumReads` column contains:

The estimated number of reads originated from each transcript.

```bash
# Your command:
cut -f 1,5 results/salmon_quant/S63/quant.sf | sort -k2,2 -n -r | head -n 3
```

The output of the command was:

```
XM_039591534.2  24004.889
XM_039573735.1  8663.254
XM_039573733.1  4774.749
```

### 10: The gene of the top transcript

```bash
# Your command:
zcat data/ref/GCF_016801865.2_TS_CPP_V2_rna.fna.gz | grep 'XM_039591534.2' 
```

The output of the command was:

```
>XM_039591534.2 PREDICTED: Culex pipiens pallens vitellogenin-A1-like (LOC120426760), mRNA
```

*Answer*: The gene that the top transcript belongs to:

Culex pipiens pallens vitellogenin-A1-like (LOC120426760)

### 11: Mapping rates

```bash
# Your command:
grep 'mapping rate' results/salmon_quant/S*/logs/salmon_quant.log
```

The output of the command was:

```
results/salmon_quant/S63/logs/salmon_quant.log:mapping rate: 82.4560%
results/salmon_quant/S64/logs/salmon_quant.log:mapping rate: 81.9152%
